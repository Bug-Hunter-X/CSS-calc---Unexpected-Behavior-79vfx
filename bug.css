The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a `width` property of an element nested within another element might not behave as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Also, the order of operations within `calc()` expressions may cause unexpected results without proper use of parentheses.
